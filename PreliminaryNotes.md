- Mobile first UI approach might be good idea for basic admin work.

- Simple UI but handy and fast.

- Search, category, pagination? A kind of filtering.
- Order by time traking.

- Clasifications by importance?

- Time tracking between raising, opening and solving

SIMPLE USER STORIES TO HELP WITH THE DIFFERENT VIEW POINTS

As a guest 

As a regular user
- When I spot a bug or suggest an idea, I want all the state and view from where I started the ticket to be at my disposal at the moment
  of the ticket creation, so I can pick watever I need to create the ticket.
- When I create a ticket it is good to have some colored pen and arrow tools to draw over the state(the state picture) and some formatting tools, so I can describe the ticket in fast and disambiguous way.
- When the ticket is created, I want to track if it is viewd, opened, solved or if there's some feedback from the person assigned to my ticket.
